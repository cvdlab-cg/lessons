# Yet Another Version of *Marseille Model*


On file `model4.py` you may find an example of data structure transformation from `pyplasm` (hpc type) to `larlib` (LAR model).  

The data transformation is executed by the `plasm2lar(hpc)` function invocation, where `hpc` is the name of the geometric value of the model to transform.
 
Just run the file, after having suitably changed the value of the variable `project_path` in the `model.py` file.
